.SH NAME
.B hsh
- command language interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
hsh is one version of a command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input, this version was made with academic porpouses. It's functionality is limited to few shell builtin functions

.SS Invocation
An
.I interactive
hsh can be invoked by typing ./hsh Meanwhile, a
.I non-interactive
hsh can also be invoked via a pipe (e.g. echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh).
.SS Execution
After a command is typed in the input the function string_token will split into separate words , if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are taken.
.sp
If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it the built-in command first. If there is not existent built-in command, the prog	ram will searh for an existent shell command in all the directories belonging to the PATH. 
.sp
If the name is neither a shell function nor a built-in, and contains no slashes, the simple shell searches each element of the environmental variable PATH for a directory containing an executable file by that name. If the search is unsuccessful, the hsh prints an error message "Error: File or description not found."
